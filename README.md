# Getting Started

This is a basic chrome extension that hides the images and videos. If you are looking for this, you probably already know what to use this for.

# Loading the extension

The extensions policy changed in the Google Chrome Store. So I'm not planning to publish this there. If you want to use it, you'd have to load this as a developer extension following these [steps](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).
